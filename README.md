# parcoord-fx
Parallel Coordinates Chart for Java FX.

Created over the course of the lecture Information Visualization (http://courses.iicm.tugraz.at/ivis/) held at Graz University of Technology.

Supports the display of records with an arbitrary amount of dimensions (axes). Provides interaction support such as: filtering, brushing, selecting (highlighting), reordering of the axes, and inverting the axes.

Can be used as a standalone tool as well as a library in a separate project as described in the documentation. The doc folder contains both a javadoc as well as a pdf with further descriptions and instructions. The release folder contains the jar representing the library as well the executable tool. Under src/data, example csv-files can be found which are importable in the standalone tool for demonstration of the functionalities.
